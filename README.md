# Firepoint

Firepoint is a planned, account-optional mobile web app for emergency awareness and personal preparedness in Glendale, California. Nearby Southern California coverage is a future possibility **only where source coverage and rights have been checked**. A resident should be able to choose an area, find clearly attributed hazard information and links to agency notices, and keep a personal preparation checklist. The area-specific, source-backed parts of this plan are **proposed, not shipped**; see the current status below.

**Live-source release gate:** NWS, fire/air and Glendale GIS adapters exist, but the production source panel and POST queries are paused pending rights, caching, rate limits and monitoring. The local-only `FIREPOINT_DEMO_LIVE_SOURCES=enabled` switch is for developer integration tests, not a public coverage claim. The map and official agency links are separate.

**Not an official City of Glendale service.** Firepoint does not issue evacuation orders, determine whether a place is safe, or provide an all-clear. For an emergency, follow the responsible public agency and local emergency services. Do not rely on this app as your only source of information.

## App preview

[Current mobile Mapbox home](docs/preview/map-mobile.png) · [Desktop map](docs/preview/map-desktop.png) · [Official links and paused-check mobile page](docs/preview/prepare-mobile.png). These were captured from real app code and a real public Mapbox token, with **no live source queries or private marks**. The flame toolbar is for private marks, **not** verified fires; its icon/wording is under review. The map images are snapshots, not a forecast or an automatically refreshed live feed.

[The preview workflow](.github/workflows/preview.yml) separately refreshes [`/prepare` desktop](docs/preview/desktop.png) and [mobile](docs/preview/mobile.png) screenshots after `main` pushes. It does not load the optional second map or query live sources. The Mapbox home requires internet and a browser-publishable, URL-restricted token.

## What exists now

This repository began as a Next.js 16 starter and is under active development. The **`/` homepage is a full-screen Mapbox map** when a public `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN` is configured. It loads online without a tap and has a dark/light toggle and user-placed private flame marks; the marks are **not** confirmed incidents, and the map has no official zone, order, fire perimeter or safe-route overlay. The older, click-to-load OpenFreeMap map remains on `/prepare`, so **two basemap providers currently coexist** pending map-owner consolidation. Neither map is available offline. The `/prepare` page holds official agency links, a local checklist and an optional Glenoaks Canyon reference label; no label or saved mark is an official lookup.

Server-only adapters for NWS weather alerts, CAL FIRE incidents, NIFC/WFIGS perimeters, AirNow observations and dated Glendale GIS standing-hazard maps are installed. **Production UI and personalized POST routes are paused** while source rights, caching, rate limits and monitoring are reviewed. `FIREPOINT_DEMO_LIVE_SOURCES=enabled` permits explicit queries in local nonproduction development only; it is not a public coverage claim. None of these sources checks a City/County evacuation order or verified standing evacuation zone. An offline fallback keeps a separate local checklist, **not** live notices, maps or a safe route. There is no durable ingestion worker, report service or ElevenLabs endpoint.

## Run locally

Use Node.js and npm compatible with the checked-in `package-lock.json`:

```bash
npm ci
cp .env.example .env.local  # add a public Mapbox pk. token for tiles; keep other keys server-only
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3000>. The local page is development software, not a deployed emergency service. Before a change is ready for review, run:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
# or: make check
```

The `Makefile` also has `make gis-fetch`/`make gis-local` developer-only MCP steps. GitHub Actions runs these four web checks for PRs and `main` pushes, with no secret-dependent source calls. Report the result of each command separately. Lint, typecheck, tests, and build do not establish agency source coverage or operational readiness.

## Plan and working agreements

- [Team start](docs/team-start.md): setup, small-change workflow, review gates, and proposed feature boundaries.
- [Source policy](docs/source-policy.md): source trust, coverage, freshness, location privacy, offline behavior, and reports.
- [Data contracts](docs/contracts.md): proposed and implemented schemas; check its status notes before claiming a route or UI integration exists.
- [Map decisions](docs/maps.md): current Mapbox home, secondary OpenFreeMap map, attribution, cost, privacy and limits.
- [PWA storage, systems, audio and route handoff](docs/pwa-storage-and-systems.md): shipped versus proposed behavior and provenance gates.
- [Crowd reports and tiered map research](docs/crowd-report-zones.md): unverified report-density concept, not a fire perimeter or safe zone.
- [Resident stories](docs/user-stories.md), [four-person scope](docs/hackathon-roles.md), and [source/storage roadmap](docs/source-roadmap.md): proposals and ownership boundaries, not shipped services.
- [Product vision](docs/vision.md) and [broader API roadmap](docs/roadmap.md): teammate proposals for later phases. Check their assumptions against the source policy and current status before promising a live feature.

Implemented adapters include NWS point alerts, CAL FIRE incidents, NIFC/WFIGS current perimeters, AirNow observations and Glendale GIS dated hazard maps. All are request-time with no durable cache or polling; production queries are paused. NWS is inactive without a real identifying contact and AirNow without a key. None of them is an evacuation feed. Other documents describe future work. Before showing a source in the app, verify its publisher, jurisdiction, update behavior, access terms, and geographic coverage. Never substitute a map view, neighborhood name, or empty feed response for an evacuation status.
